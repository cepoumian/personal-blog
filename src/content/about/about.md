title: About Me
---

Hi, I’m Cesar. I’m a web developer and designed hailing from Mexico.

I’ve been working as a developer for 5 years now, mainly as a frontend engineer in enterprise applications. During this time, one of the things I’ve struggled the most is following through with personal projects.

I’ve started this blog to keep myself accountable and properly follow through with any work that is personal, be it a development or deign project, an idea, a course, etc.

A little bit about me…

I started working full-time as a dev in 2020. Before that, I worked in education, educational technology, e-learning, etc.

I have a masters degree in Multimedia Design with a specialization in Web and Mobile products.

The things I enjoy the most are tech and music. In my spare time, I enjoy making music.
